## Pre-Protocol Assignment: Data Pitch

The protocol assignment which you will be adding to and refining throughout the ten-week quarter can be more valuable and enjoyable if you work in a group. This is not a requirement, but I highly encourage it. To form groups we will ‘pitch’ ideas about what kind of data and what kind of audience you would like to create a protocol for. No matter whether you intend to join a group or work independently, please post your idea on the discussion board (directions below).

Here are the requirements:
- In 2-3 sentences explain what your topic is and why you think it is relevant to this course.
- In 1-2 sentences describe a potential audience for this protocol (in business speak: who are your stakeholders?).
- Provide a link(s) and a short description (1-2 sentences) of relevant open data that you could curate for the project. The data must be publicly accessible such that anyone can, with minimal effort, access it. Don’t worry if you end up finding different datasets for pieces of the assignment in the future - I just want you to share some examples of datasets that fit within your desired topic. After all you may join a group that does an entirely different topic, that’s okay.

On Canvas I have created a [forum where you can post your data pitch](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1641385/discussion_topics/8008442). Please post these by the end of Week 2 (April 07, 2021).
